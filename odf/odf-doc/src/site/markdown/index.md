# Overview

The "Open Discovery Framework" is an open metadata-based framework that strives to be a common home for different analytics technologies that discover characteristics of data sets and relationships between them (think "AppStore for discovery algorithms"). Using ODF, applications can leverage new discovery algorithms and their results with minimal integration effort.

Automated characterization of information and automated discovery of relationships is key to several Analytics Platform initiatives, e.g. enable and improve self service for knowledge workers.
The Open Discovery Platform provides infrastructure based on open source technology to easily execute, manage and integrate diverse metadata discovery algorithms provided by internal
or external (open source) contributors in a single point of access. These discovery algorithms store their analysis results in a common open metadata
repository that promotes reuse and sharing of these results.
A simple plug-in mechanism to integrate discovery services enables users of ODF to easily combine and orchestrate algorithms built on different technologies,
thereby gaining deeper insights into their data.
